C++ is a programming language that exhibits both strengths and weaknesses based on various evaluation criteria. One aspect to consider is simplicity, which can affect the readability of programs. C++ offers a wide range of operators and features, which can sometimes lead to confusion or difficulty in understanding code, especially for novice programmers. While operator overloading allows for flexibility in defining custom behaviors for operators, it can also introduce ambiguity if not used carefully. Additionally, C++ lacks orthogonality in certain areas, such as the inconsistent treatment of arrays and structures, which can complicate program logic and lead to unexpected behavior.

However, C++ also possesses strengths in terms of writability. Its extensive feature set provides programmers with powerful tools to express complex algorithms concisely. Despite some complexity, C++ allows for expressive coding, such as using shorthand notations like `count++` for incrementing variables. The language's expressivity contributes to its writability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and problem domains.

In terms of reliability, C++ offers both advantages and challenges. Type checking in C++ is primarily performed at compile time, which helps catch errors early in the development process. However, the language allows for aliasing, which can introduce subtle bugs and reduce code reliability if not managed carefully. Exception handling capabilities in C++ provide mechanisms to deal with runtime errors effectively, enhancing program robustness.

Considering cost, C++ may incur higher training costs due to its complexity compared to simpler languages. However, its extensive feature set can also lead to increased productivity and potentially lower development costs in the long term. Maintenance costs may vary depending on the readability of the codebase, with well-structured and understandable code being easier to maintain.

Overall, while C++ may have complexities and challenges, its rich feature set and expressive capabilities make it a versatile language suitable for a wide range of applications. However, developers should be mindful of its intricacies and invest in proper training and code management practices to maximize its benefits while minimizing potential drawbacks.

                                then error
                                else M_1 (while B do L, M_s1(L, s))

A.
x = 4 * y;
y= 4x + 2; {y < 8}
$$
4x + 2 \lt 8 \\
4x \lt 6 \\
x \lt \frac{3}{2} \\
\text{Substituting } x = 4 * y \\
4 * y \lt \frac{3}{2} \\
y \lt \frac{3}{8}
$$

A.
if (x > y) y=4*x + 2
else y = 2*x+8; {y > 4}

case 1: if (x > y)
$$
4x + 2 \gt 4\\
x \gt \frac{1}{2}
$$

case 1: if (x <= y)
$$
2x+8 \gt 4\\
x \gt -2
$$

Since $\frac{1}{2} \gt -2$ and $x \gt \frac{1}{2}$, the weakest precondition is $x \gt \frac{1}{2}$.
